            "As you know, the automotive market has been an absolute seller’s market this past year, especially in the used-vehicle segment. There are several causes, but the shortage of new models caused by the microchip shortage has played a big part in sending used-car prices through the roof.It has reached a point where we are hearing increasing reports of models selling for more on the used-car market than when they were brand-new. It's a question of supply and demand, and it's what happens when manufacturers can't keep up with hot demand for new vehicles.Prices in the used car market are bound to climb in that situation. For one, used vehicles are available right away, so no waiting months for delivery of a new model. Many consumers are evidently willing to pay more to get a slightly pre-owned vehicle so they don't have to wait."

            "It's hard not to fall for the many offers and subsidies on electric vehicles these days. But is it worth it? Jump on your calculator: The price of fuel at the pump has a direct impact on the demand for electric cars. As the price of gasoline rises and remains at record highs, interest in these vehicles increases. The government's electric conversion bonus also encourages this reflection and desire to switch from thermal to electric vehicles.But it is not that simple. The price of electric cars is much higher than that of an equivalent combustion model. The difference, for the same model, between the internal combustion and electric versions is significant. In France, we are talking about 10,000€.The question of the bonus:Why a bonus? There is certainly a drastic desire on the part of governments to encourage drivers to switch to electric cars, but not everyone is ready or convinced of the savings they will make.In France, a country that is a champion of incentives, several governmental aids help to absorb this price difference. The best known is the ecological bonus with a ceiling of €5,000. Only fully electric vehicles and some plug-in hybrids or hydrogen vehicles are eligible. In several regions, it is possible to benefit from additional advantages: purchase bonus, free parking, subsidies for the installation of charging stations for individuals and co-ownerships.If you own an old gasoline vehicle registered before 2006 or diesel before 2011, you can also get a maximum conversion bonus of €5,000 depending on your income."
